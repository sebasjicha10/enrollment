<h1>Enrollment page</h1> <hr>
This project consists of a simple enrollment page for courses given by my local university (UCR).</br>
It is built using Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.</br>
To get in, the user can log in, if previously registered, or sign up.</br>
The initial registration works with a predefined database where the university has a list of students and their corresponding students' ids,</br>
so it validates that the user is, in fact, a student at UCR.</br>
Once in, a dashboard (Index page) displays a list of the already successfully enrolled courses by the user.</br>
One can add courses either by clicking on "Add Course" in the dashboard, or "Enrollment" on the navigation bar.</br>
This will redirect the user to a page where the available course options are displayed, with additional useful information.</br>
After selecting the course and providing the password, the course is added to the dashboard.</br>
Additionally, the page offers 2 more actions:</br>
"Schedule", where the enrolled courses are displayed dynamically in a weekly-hourly schedule, for visual aid,</br>
and "Personal Info" where the user can update the information given at signing up or change his or her password.</br>
